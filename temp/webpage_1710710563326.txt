Composed of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), CDS – People's Party (CDS–PP) and People's Monarchist Party (PPM), the alliance is a relaunch of the eponymous alliance which contested elections between 1979 & 1983. First attempts[edit] Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa led an attempt to establish a new Democratic Alliance in 1998, between the PSD and the People's Party (CDS–PP; the former CDS), led by Paulo Portas. It contested the 2004 European elections as Força Portugal, but was subsequently dissolved. However, both the PSD and CDS–PP later agreed to contest the 2014 European elections under a joint list called the Portugal Alliance. In the 2015 legislative election, PSD and CDS-PP ran together in a coalition called Portugal Ahead. The Democratic Alliance was revived in the Azores only to contest the 2022 elections. The coalition polled second with 34% of the votes and elected 2 MPs to Parliament.[1] 2024 Democratic Alliance[edit] After the 2022 legislative election and for the first time in history, CDS–PP failed to win any seats and was wiped out of parliament. In December 2023, Luís Montenegro and Nuno Melo announced a coalition for the 2024 legislative and European Parliament elections, including the Social Democratic Party (PPD/PSD), the CDS – People's Party (CDS–PP) and some independent politicians under the name Democratic Alliance (AD).[2] At first, the People's Monarchist Party (PPM) refused to join the alliance, citing the "weakness" and "lack of vision" of its leaders,[3] but they later rescinded this position and joined the coalition.[4] The agreement for the coalition was signed on 7 January 2024 between Luís Montenegro, Nuno Melo and Gonçalo da Câmara Pereira, with Miguel Guimarães representing the independents that are also present in the coalition.[5] This coalition granted CDS–PP two easily eligible seats and four potentially eligible seats, thus making the return of CDS-PP to the Parliament after the 2024 election almost certain.[6] The coalition will also grant one possibly eligible seat to the PPM.[7] The coalition was also revived for the 2024 Azorean regional election.
